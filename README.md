All files should be .lua files. To put them into Realearn, do the following one at a time for each:
  1. Copy lua text
  2. Press 'Import from Clipboard' on Realearn
  Note: For Controller preset, make sure the 'Controller Compartment' is selected on the 'Show' options. For actual controls, such as DAW control and EQ preset, select 'Main Compartment' on the 'Show' options.

For information on how Realearn works and how to link presets to specific plugins, look at Realearn's official GitHub (https://github.com/helgoboss/helgobox) and/or watch the video tutorials for Helgobox/Realearn (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0bFMT0iEtAgKY2BUSyjEO1I4s20lZa5G)
